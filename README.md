# Chipy Project Night March 16, 2017


## The Event

[ChiPy's](http://www.chipy.org/) monthly project night [hosted at Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/careers). On this particular night we put on an impromptu coding dojo.

## The Coding Dojo Format
Split into teams of four of five- usually one more experienced member paired with others with little or no programming experience. Each member gets a 15 minute turn driving at the keyboard.

## The Task

* Create an API that serves up random jokes.
* Create an API that searches for jokes for a keyword
* Create a GUI Client with TKinter that interacts with the API

## Running the code

In one shell,
`python app.py`
In another shell,
`python client.py`

That's it!
